= INSTALLATION =

To install the theme, simply copy the folder you just downloaded to your themes directory (wordpress/wp-content/themes/), using your favourite ftp tool. After that, go to Appearance > Themes in your WordPress Admin Panel and activate the theme.





= LIMITATIONS & KNOWN ISSUES =

Using a featured image (post thumbnail)
	
This theme allows you to use a thumbnail for your posts, however, it will be resized to a fixed width and height of 80 x 80 pixels to fit into the layout. Keep in mind: If your image is not quadratic, this results in an stretched image!

Header Navigation Menu
	
Please do not put a thousand items into the header menu, or it will break into multiple lines which is not intended. Six to nine items should easily fit into the bar. If you would like to display more items, you may use a second menu within the sidebar for this purpose.
However, it is always advisable to present as few items as possible in the primary navigation, which is why I am not thinking about adding a pretty solution for two- or more-rows header menus.

Removing the glass-effect overlay from the header
	
If you do not like the glassy overlay, you have to make some changes in header.php template manually.
If necessary, download the file from the themes folder to your computer, then open it with your favourite texteditor (Notepad or TextEdit will do). Search for the line "<span id="headerOverlay"></span>" (~ line 86) and delete it. Save header.php and upload it again (overwrite it, if asked).

Theme may be bugged in old Internet Explorer
	
Though I do not expect major issues regarding legacy Internet Explorer compatibility, there may be some minor flaws - leaving aside the fact that I am not including a PNG-Fix. I am not testing for older IE compatibility with this release. I may address this in a future minor update. If you encounter any major bugs, please contact me: http://www.arcance.net/contact





= GET SUPPORT =

I found a bug! There is a faulty translation!
	
Sorry for that. I probably drank to less coffee the night I was working on that. It would be very kind, if you could report any bugs or flaws you encounter. There are several ways to do so:
Write me an email: http://www.arcance.net/contact
Open a support thread on wordpress.org: http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/blackmesa
Email is way faster - I do not often check the wordpress.org tickets

- - - - -

I am missing a feature. Can you add it? I have another question!
	
Feel free to ask whatever you want. If I can, I will help you. But keep in mind that I am not able to help with WordPress issues in general, not directly related to my themes.
